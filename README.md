# Story-Objective-Quest Editor Tool (SOQET)
SOQET is a new tool which has been created to streamline the process of creating objectives and quests in video games. This tool aims to improve the productivity and efficiency of game developers worldwide.

# Features
SOQET provides a simple to use interface for creating and managing objectives and quests. It uses an event based architecture to allow developers handle quests, objectives, and stories to make it easy to track progress. It allows developers to communicate the progress and status of objectives and quests to other game systems to trigger events or actions.
The tool is designed to be easy to use, however, right now, you will need some programming experience to add feedbacks. I plan to mitigate this issue in the future through visual scripting. 

# Getting Started
To get started with SOQET, simply download the repository from Github and open the SOQET unity project and play/study the sample scene. SOQET documentation will be made available in the near future, after which, you can explore the documentation and then start using SOQET to create and manage objectives and quests in your games.

# Contributing
I appreciate your interest in contributing to this project. However, I am not currently accepting contributions. If you have any suggestions or issues to report, feel free to create an issue on the project's repository. Thank you for your understanding.

# License
SOQET is free to use, but it is not open source. You are free to use the framework in your own projects, but you may not modify, sell, or distribute the code.


SOQET is complete. As of 17/06/2023, all that remains is documentation before it is released on the Unity Asset Store.
