# SOQET
SOQET(Story-Objective-Quest Editor Tool) is a new tool which is being created to streamline the process of creating objectives and quests in video games. This tool aims to improve the productivity and efficiency of game developers worldwide.

SOQET is designed to help game developers create objectives and quests more efficiently. This tool is being created with the intention of making it easier for developers to create engaging and exciting missions for players. It simplifies the process of creating objectives by allowing developers to create objectives and quests using a simple easy to use interface.

SOQET works by allowing developers to create a hierarchy of objectives and quests, making it easy to manage and track the progress of quests. The tool also allows developers to easily add feedback for completing objectives, making it easier to balance the game and keep players motivated.

The tool is designed to be easy to use, however, right now, you will need some programming experience to add feedbacks. I plan to mitigate this issue in the future through visual scripting. 

SOQET is being developed with the intention of improving the productivity and efficiency of game developers worldwide. It allows developers to create engaging objectives and quests quickly and easily, freeing up time to focus on other aspects of game development. Ultimately, the tool helps to create a more immersive and enjoyable gaming experience for players.

SOQET is currently still in development. As of 25/04/2023, data persistence is the final basic feature before it is released on the Unity Asset Store.
